# Proyecto_MD

For this project we had a dataset with information about fetal deaths and births in Guatemala. It had different features,
but they were all demographic. The main goal of the project was to make a machine learning model that could predict
wether a fetus was in danger of fetal death or not.

## Results

![results](https://github.com/Daniel14gonc/Proyecto_MD/blob/main/results.png)

As you can see in the table, we used several machine learning models to try predict the result of the birth. They were all good, but the
Simple Neural Network outperformed the others.

We made a [paper](https://github.com/Daniel14gonc/Proyecto_MD/blob/main/Paper.pdf) were you can see the results of the models and the EDA.
